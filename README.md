# Mini Rogue
CS32 Spring 2015

Developed an action-adventure game where the player navigates through a
multi-level dungeon of procedurally generated mazes filled with various monsters.

Employed Object Oriented Design principles to implement an intuitive system of
interacting objects with proper inheritance and polymorphisms.

Applied recursion to intelligently move monsters in relation to the player's distance.
